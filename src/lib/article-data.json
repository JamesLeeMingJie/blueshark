      "paragraph1": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",
      "paragraph2": "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.",
      "paragraph3": "The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.",

      "paragraph4": "In an era driven by e-commerce and changing consumer needs, the importance of seamless transportation has only grown. Fleet management profoundly impacts your business, and procuring your own vehicle fleet is among one of the most important business decisions you’ll make.",
      "subBanner1": "/articleInternal/sub-banner/sub__banner-1.png",
      "paragraph5": "When it comes to procuring a new fleet of vehicles for your business, there are 3 factors to consider: <br><br><ul class='pl-8'><li>1. Initial Investment</li><li>2. Depreciation</li><li>3. Loan Interest</li></ul><br>Let’s break down the cost of starting your own fleet team for a simple Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) or petrol motorbike versus the <a class='text-primary font-bold' href='https://blueshark.com.my/r-series/overview'>Blueshark Smart Electric Scooters</a> through our simple case study.",
      "paragraph6": "Acquiring a fleet of standard petrol bikes comes at a high cost of capital expenditure. For instance, for a business owner who wants to invest in 50 bikes, the estimated average cost of purchasing an ordinary ICE motorbike would be RM8,000. The business owner will then need to fork out a <span class='underline'>sum of RM400,000.</span>",
      "subBanner2": "/articleInternal/sub-banner/sub__banner-2.png",
      "paragraph7": "With the <span class='text-black font-bold'>Blueshark Leasing Programme</span>, you can start a fleet with only just RM24,350 for the same number of bikes. This would mean your starting Capex will only be 6% of the RM400,000 cost of purchasing a fleet inventory of ICE bikes. Our monthly subscription plan for a bike starts <span class='underline'>as low as RM 487 per month.</span>",
      "paragraph8": "When it comes to the Blueshark Leasing Programme— the choice is clear. Businesses no longer have to worry about being locked into long-term contracts or committing to a fixed fleet size. Instead, our programme provides businesses with the flexibility to pause their subscription and to adjust their fleet size based on their specific needs or market demands. This allows them to adapt and respond quickly to changes in their industry or market conditions.",
      "paragraph9": "With our leasing model, the same budget can be used for more meaningful business activities, such as business expansion or for business operations. Blueshark allows organisations of all sizes (small, medium or large enterprises) to engage fleet management in a more cost-effective way.",
