Our monthly subscription plan for a bike starts <span class='underline'>as low as RM 487 per month.</span>",
      "paragraph8": "When it comes to the Blueshark Leasing Programme— the choice is clear. Businesses no longer have to worry about being locked into long-term contracts or committing to a fixed fleet size. Instead, our programme provides businesses with the flexibility to pause their subscription and to adjust their fleet size based on their specific needs or market demands. This allows them to adapt and respond quickly to changes in their industry or market conditions.",

Blueshark allows organisations of all sizes (small, medium or large enterprises) to engage fleet management in a more cost-effective way.",
